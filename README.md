OTHER IDEAS:
-	Special way of implementing friendship score 
= earned by chatting, going out, event participating and shared posts 
= gives different looks to your friends and family on the map depending on your trophies with that person 
-	When tagging someone in a post, the post appears in the other personâ€™s friend feed too.
-	Close friends list below the bio which has all your best friends in the app listed down below.
= when you click on a person from that list, shared posts, gone events and etc. come up to show your memories
-	On the map when you go out with your friends, it shows the name of your crew 
= a crew can be formed by creating a group chat in the Chats, and the name of the crew can be changed there and on the map dynamically.
-	On the map you can see all cultural monuments and sightseeing objects (Rilski manastir I tn) in a special way
= you will also get points when visiting those.
